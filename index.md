# Hello World

My name is Kyle E. and I am a student at Cal State Fullerton(http://www.fullerton.edu/) and 
my major is currently business but I may pursue other majors in the close future.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 2 (https://csufullerton.instructure.com/courses/3453286/assignments/37261543)

    Lab 2, part 1 was a favorite because it was my very first time actually coding and seeing 
    the actual effects of my code. Typing out std::cout and seeing the terminal type out what 
    I gave it was magicial. It was my very first step into the world of computer science and 
    it will hold a special place for me.

* Lab 7 (https://github.com/orgs/cpsc-fall-2024/teams/miles-and-kyle)

    Lab 7, part 1 was very fun for me as it almost felt like a puzzle. Having to find ways 
    for the code to differentiate days and hours that were okay and were unavailable was 
    quite fun. It tested my knowledge of my use of if and while statements.

* Lab 10 (https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2024/cpsc-120-lab-10-jocelyn-kyle)

    Lab 10, part 1 was interesting for me as I had to make 2D vectors with my partner. 
    Learning the intricacies of vectors within vectors and the usage of at.() commands was 
    quite the challenge. It took a while to finish but it was very rewarding when we did, and 
    it expanded my knowledge upon vectors.
